itertools python -> check all possible combinations
np verrifier -> yes answer in polynomial time

greedy -> input cases that will not find the value
anytime : give time return best answer
complete search -> always find the value

Dimacs -> big dataset with things

Initial Idea: count the number of first literal negations, then take num_clauses - first_negations = first_bools.
now find if there are more negations or more bools. Store that number. repeat for the second and third literals 
and find the max of the three. that is your upper bound.
(could we do min and find a solution?)

What is Linear Programming (LP) Relaxation?
For the Linear Programming (LP) Relaxation, we replace the original Boolean variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ (which are either 0 or 1) with continuous variables $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ that can take on any fractional value between 0 and 1.

**a clause is satisfied if at least one literal is true**

Reduction options:
Max Clique 
Longest Path (Optimization) 
Max Cut

I will do Max Clique:
The maximum clique problem is a computational challenge in graph theory to find 
the largest possible subset of vertices in a graph where every two vertices are 
connected by an edge.
